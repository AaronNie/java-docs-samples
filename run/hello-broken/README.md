# Cloud Run Broken Sample

This sample presents broken code in need of troubleshooting. An alternate
resource at `/improved` shows a more stable implementation with more informative
errors and default values.

Use it with the [Local Container Troubleshooting tutorial](http://cloud.google.com/run/docs/tutorials/local-troubleshooting).

For more details on how to work with this sample read the [Google Cloud Run Java Samples README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/java-docs-samples/tree/master/run).
